## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This portfolio is made not to only show my other projects but to be a way to show my skills. I'll be using some new approaches to challenge myself.
## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
* Vite - You're going to use the [Vite Package Manager](https://vitejs.dev) to manage your front-end packages. Make sure you've installed Node.js and npm first, then install vite globally using npm:

```bash
$ npm install -g vite
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
